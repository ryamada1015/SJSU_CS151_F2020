Integer is a class that implements different methods to give flexibility in using an int data while int is only a data type.
Benefits of using Integer:
- It can perform various operations to change its value on an int data such as reverse() and rotateLeft(0.
- String can be converted to an int value.
- Integer objects can be used in collections like ArrayList and Queue.
- It can convert an int value to other base such as binary and hexadecimal.
The primitive int only takes 32 bits while Integer takes 128 bits so int is useful when you don't need to perform operations above.
